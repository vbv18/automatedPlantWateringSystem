# automatedPlantWateringSystem
The automated plant watering system uses a soil moisture sensor to detect dryness and a relay to control a water pump. An ultrasonic sensor measures water levels, displaying them on a 7-segment display. The Arduino-based system ensures efficient irrigation by activating the pump only when needed, preventing overwatering and optimizing water usage.
